## Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/pranav17502/CodeCipher-Keeper/
```
## Cofigure
Run on command line.
To configure and set a master password.

```bash
    python configure.py
```
This would have to run only once. This is for creating table in MySQL and configuring. If this is ran again, it will give error that the database has already been created. 

## Adding new entry
```bash
    python pm.py add -s <sitename> -u <siteurl.com> -e <youremail.com> -l <yourLoginId>
```
After this program will ask for master password. Enter the master password you have set. Then the program would ask for the password of the about entry. Write the password and hit enter. The entry would get added in the database

## Extracting the field
To see all the entries
```bash
    python pm.py e
```
This will show all the entries in the database in a tabular format. 

To extract a particular entry, use a search field. The format for searching a particular entry is:
```bash
    python pm.py e -<l> <yourFieldName>
```

## Copying the password to Clipboard
The program does not directly show the password on CMD. The only way to use the password is that the program directly copies the password to the clipboard. To do so, we have to use the above extract command and add -c at the end.

```bash
    python pm.py e -<l> <yourFieldName> -c
```




## Usage/Examples
For searching based on Site Name
```bash
    python pm.py e -s facebook 
```
For searching based on Site URL
```bash
    python pm.py e -u facebook.com 
```
For searching based on emailID
```bash
    python pm.py e -e youremailID.com 
```
For searching based on loginID
```bash
    python pm.py e -l yourLoginID 
```
For copying
```bash
    python pm.py e -s facebook -c
```
